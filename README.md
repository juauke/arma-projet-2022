Material Architecture Project --- Conception of a micro-processor in Diglog.

## Usage
The files needed to test the processor are:
- `digproc/alu.lgf`
- `digproc/combi.lgf`
- `digproc/io.lgf`
- `digproc/proc.lgf`
- `digproc/register.lgf`

The test codes are located in `tests/`.
Precisely, the codes are mainly testing the usage of the function whose name is the directory's.

The compiler source files are located in the directory `digcomp/`.
